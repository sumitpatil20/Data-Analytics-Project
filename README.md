Hotel Booking

# Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Data Analysis** workflow where we analyze a dataset to extract meaningful insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical modeling.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used for this project is [https://github.com/sumitpatil20/Data-Analytics-Project/blob/main/Hotel_bookings_dataset.csv ] (mention source if applicable)
- It contains attributes like **[ is canceled , hotel ,agent , reservation_satus_date , adr , etc.]**
- The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before performing any analysis

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for statistical modeling, if applicable)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive coding)
